# üí∞ Expense Tracker App

A simple and powerful expense tracking application built with Go and PostgreSQL. This app helps you keep track of your daily expenses, categorize them, and manage your personal finances effectively.

## üéØ What Does This App Do?

Imagine you want to know where your money goes every month. This app helps you:

- **Track Your Spending**: Record every expense you make (like buying coffee, groceries, or paying bills)
- **Organize by Categories**: Group your expenses (Food, Transportation, Entertainment, etc.)
- **Secure Access**: Only you can see your expenses with secure login
- **History Tracking**: See when and what you spent money on

Think of it as a digital notebook for your money, but smarter!

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Go programming language (version 1.21 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database installed and running

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   go mod tidy
  

2. **Set up your database:**
  
   CREATE DATABASE expense_tracker;
   

3. **Configure your environment:**
   The `.env` file contains your database settings. Update the password if needed:
   
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=expense_tracker
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
   

4. **Start the application:**
  
   go run .
   

   You'll see: `Server starting on port 3000`

- **expenses** - Your actual expense records
- **expense_categories** - Links expenses to categories
- **login_history** - Tracks when you log in
